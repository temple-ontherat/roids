<h2>Asteroids Challenge</h2>
      <p>Press the button below to check out how I'm doing with my asteroids-type game.</p>
      <p>Sorry, it's not meant for mobile phones (I haven't worked out how to do it). <p>
      <p>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the ship. Space bar to fire,</p>
      <p>right and left arrows for turning, and up arrow for thrust. What I've done</p>
      <p>recently is to add a personal high score display, random alien sizes, and alien rapid</p>
      <p>fire if you take too long on levels. What to do next? Let me know what you think!</p>  
      <p>Also, it would help me a lot if you let me know if you see any bugs or the game</p>
      <p>doesn't run on your computer. You won't hurt my feelings. It can only help make it</p>
      <p>bettter and help me be a better coder. Thanks!</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
